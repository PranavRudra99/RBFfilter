Commands to execute:

g++ sha256.cpp RBFGen.cpp -o rbfgen
./rbfgen

/*
Comments to help with execution of RBFGen:
->The file RBFGen already includes a default value for m(the value m1 calculated in 1(a)). The user is prompted whether they want to enter a value for m and if they answer(y/Y), they get a prompt to enter the value of m. Executing RBFGen generates/overwrites the RBFRow1.txt file.
*/

g++ sha256.cpp IPCheck.cpp -o ipcheck
./ipcheck
(or)
./ipcheck [pathToRBF]

/*
Comments to help with execution of IPCheck:
-> When executing the IPCheck file, you can provide an optional argument which is path to RBFRow1.txt. This path is already included in the IPCheck file, and it defaults to the RBF file generated by RBFGen. Additionally, when executing the IPCheck file, the user is prompted to enter an IP Address. 
->Although there's no pattern checking, the user is expected to enter it in the format (XXX.XXX.X.XXX) where X is a value between 0 - 9. This is the case because, even though RBF blocks IP Address: 192.168.0.001, if the user enters the IP Address: 192.168.0.1 the RBF doesn't block it.
